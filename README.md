**WristWatch** is a program that tracks your dominant hand using a webcam and makes sure that your wrist is straight at all times. If your wrist is bent for an extended period of time, Wrist Watch will then push a notification to remind you to straighten up your wrist, preventing the development of [Carpal Tunnel Syndrome](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/carpal-tunnel/carpal-tunnel-syndrome).
